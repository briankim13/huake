## Overview 

This is the result of group effort of Huake team. We made a 3D maze for Engineering Computation class. It includes multiple functionality that can also be used for other things. The game engine is capable of doing 1) forward kinematics 2) collision detection 3) visualization with texture mapping + minimap as part of game interface 4) music playing 5) writing and reading text file for keeping records.
